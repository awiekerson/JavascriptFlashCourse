<b> Javascript Flash Course Website </b>

I developed an interactive website based on a static HTML and CSS design that I found online. To enhance the user experience, I incorporated features that greet users differently depending on the time of day. Additionally, I sent an HTTP request to the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/current"> Current Weather Data API</a> from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather.org</a> and formatted the data using JSON to retrieve the user's location and use this data to display the current weather conditions, including a temperature conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Additionally, I implemented a dynamic hero section that allows users to select their desired image for display. I structured this feature so that main image objects can be easily added or removed from an array, automatically updating the available image choices for the user.

In the product section, I created a dynamic product listing that enables users to filter products by price. This feature is also structured so that adding or removing product objects from an array automatically updates the displayed products and their information.

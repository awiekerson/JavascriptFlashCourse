<b> Javascript Flash Course Website </b>

In this project, I developed an interactive website by embedding various dynamic functionalities into a pre-existing static HTML and CSS design that I found online. Additionally, I sent an HTTP request to the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/current"> Current Weather Data API</a> from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather.org</a> and formatted the data using JSON to retrieve the user's location. I used this data to display the current weather conditions and temperature as well as programmed the temperature conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. I also used Javascript's built-in Date object to format and display the user's current time. 

Additionally, I implemented a dynamic hero section that allows users to select their desired image for display. I structured this feature so that main image objects can be easily added or removed from an array, automatically updating the available image choices for the user.

In the product section, I created a dynamic product listing that enables users to filter products by price. This feature is also structured so that adding or removing product objects from an array automatically updates the displayed products and their information.
